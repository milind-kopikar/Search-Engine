#usage: 

# The crawl_web procedure to take a second parameter,
# max_depth, that limits the depth of the search.  We can 
# define the depth of a page as the number of links that must
# be followed to reach that page starting from the seed page,
# that is, the length of the shortest path from the seed to
# the page.  No pages whose depth exceeds max_depth should be
# included in the crawl.  
# 
# For example, if max_depth is 0, the only page that will
# be crawled is the seed page. If max_depth is 1, the pages
# that should be crawled are the seed page and every page that 
# it links to directly. If max_depth is 2, the crawl should 
# also include all pages that are linked to by these pages.
#
# Note that the pages in the crawl may be in any order.
